# itineraryBuilder
1. Given basic details about a plan build an entire itinerary (Ex: Rental Car/ Hotel/Activities/ etc).
We often have this usecase where everyone wants to plan an entire trip but they do not exactly know the best
time or the best route to cover maximum things or what hotels/airbnb would be better if the preferences differ
from the usual ones found online. Even after finalizing the plans we often face the daunting task of syncing lot 
of things like rental car time, different hotel bookings and plan the hotels accordingly based on the nearest
distance to the next day's activity.
All this things are technogically solvable and we believe can help users plan a painless itinerary with a set budget 
and activity preference.

We also believe lot of users face problems digging out booking information regarding Rental Cars/ Baording Pass from 
Email / specific Apps and search a different App for activities etc, so this app would be one stop solution for all these 
use cases making your trip a delight.
